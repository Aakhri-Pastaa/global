# Koii Global Bootcamp

The Koii Global program is designed to onboard developers with minimal experience in web3 and teach them how to build on Koii's distributed cloud. 

The workshop series has four lessons, each designed to help build skills that will be used to build distributed apps on Cloud2. 

### 1. Cryptography 101
Understand the  core cryptographic primatives that web3 is built on, and deploy your first token. 

### 2. Basic Distributed App Deployment
Build your first app on Koii, a Low-Fi DOS Game!

### 3. Mechanism Design and Tokenized Payments
Build a distributed web crawler and pay with your new token from Lesson 1, then deploy to thousands of Koii Nodes.

### 4. Implementing Basic LLMs with Context on Cloud2
