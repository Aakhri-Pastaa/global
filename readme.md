# Koii Global Bootcamp

The Koii Global program is designed to onboard developers with minimal experience in web3 and teach them how to build on Koii's distributed cloud. 

The workshop series has four lessons, each designed to help build skills that will be used to build distributed apps on Cloud2. 

### 1. Cryptography 101
Understand the core cryptographic primatives that web3 is built on, and deploy your first token. 

### 2. Basic Distributed App Deployment
Build your first app on Koii, a Low-Fi DOS Game! This lesson will help you familiarize yourself with development on Cloud2, with a fun and easy first Koii Task. 

### 3. GenAI, Mechanism Design, and Tokenized Payments
Build a bot army and unleash them on Twitter Bluesky. Learn how to use Google Gemini and pay Koii Nodes in your own token to spread the word online.
